"# geometric-median" 
The problem is known as the geometric median problem or the Fermatâ€“Weber problem. The geometric median is a point that minimizes the sum of distances to a given set of points. There isn't a simple formula to compute the geometric median, especially for a large number of points. However, there are algorithms to approximate it. One common algorithm to find an approximate solution is the Weiszfeld's algorithm. It's an iterative algorithm where you start with an initial guess for the geometric median and iteratively refine it until convergence.
